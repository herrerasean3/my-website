                        A long time hobby of mine is Tabletop Gaming. The phrase carries different meanings depending on who in the hobby you ask, though my own passion within Tabletop Games would be Roleplaying Games. When I was first introduced by a friend to Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition some six odd years ago, it baffled me. I had all these options for building characters? In addition to pre-built settings, campaigns, and adventures, the GM could homebrew all of the above for an experience unique to your table? Having been so attached to computer games, the idea of acting outside of established parameters was a freedom that was both amazing and terrifying. As the years progressed, I wandered from group to group until I found some friends to really sit down and truly enjoy the hobby with. We all shared a single ideal vision, that a game was best done when the GM and the players engaged in a paranoid dance of death with each other, that a player's worth would be made apparent through a crucible of lethal encounters, even deadlier traps, and potentially ruinous bouts of political intrigue. When we discovered the Fantasy Craft system and how flexible it could be, we felt the need to give it at least one try. Since that day two and a half years ago, it has become our primary RPG system and our list of adventures has only grown. What this adventure, The Crypt of Ereshkigal, could be called is a test to myself on planning a simple adventure for some dear friends. In writing this and making it availale to the net at large, I hope that others may enjoy playing it as much as I did writing it.
