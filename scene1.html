                    <p>
                        A recently abandoned tent is hidden near the entrance to the crypt. With a DC 10 Notice check, the party will notice it. The party may take a Team Sliding DC Investigate check to search the tent. With a 10, they will come across a leftover firesteel and 7 days of rations. With a 15, they'll also find 2 pints of lantern oil. With a 20, they find a journal buried underneath the bedroll. The journals earlier entries are merely an inventory of a village storehouse, however its more recent pages contain a list of observations regarding the massive steel gate at the entrance to the crypt. In order to open the gate, two levers in the entrance hall must be held down. If either of the levers are released, the gate will close in 5 minutes. There are holes in the ceiling of the entrance hall that new guards exit from, indicating a possible exit he could use with a rope. The author details their own plan of waiting for the next round of captives taken by undead, and sprinting in as the gate closes.
